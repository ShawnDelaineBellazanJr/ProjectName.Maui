# AI-Powered .NET MAUI Application

This project is a cross-platform .NET MAUI application powered by the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework. It integrates AI-driven task processing with a dynamic and responsive UI built using Telerik or Syncfusion components.

## 🚀 Features

- ✨ Semantic Kernel AI Agent Integration
- 📱 .NET MAUI cross-platform UI (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS)
- 🎨 Telerik or Syncfusion UI components (customizable)
- ⚙️ MVVM architecture using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm
- 🧠 Goal-oriented AI interaction
- 📡 Optional backend orchestration with .NET Aspire
- ☁️ Supports cloud and GitHub sync for configuration and plugins

## 📂 Project Structure

```
/Agents              - AI agents and configurations
/Configs             - JSON/YAML config files for plugins and settings
/Models              - Domain models
/Services            - AI processing, API connectors, etc.
/ViewModels          - MVVM logic layer
/Views               - XAML UI pages
/App.xaml.cs         - Application entry point
/Program.cs          - Bootstrap AI and Dependency Injection
```

## 🔧 Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Add your OpenAI API key in `Program.cs`
3. Run the project using Visual Studio 2022+ with .NET 8 or 9 installed

## 🧠 Prompt Example

When the app launches, it will ask:

> What do you want me to work on?

You can say something like:

> Generate a list of tasks for a startup founder

The AI agent will process your input and return structured output via the UI.

## 📦 Future Additions

- Dynamic plugin loader via GitHub API
- MAUI to Aspire backend communication (gRPC or REST)
- Offline JSON-driven fallback agent mode
- Advanced UI analytics and dashboards
